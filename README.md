An adaptation of the *Spartan's Scytale* with a little twist thrown into the mix.

### The Scytale

The Spartan's Scytale is an encoding system that works by writing on a slip of paper wrapped around a staff. By unwinding the writing, the text would appear scrambled! This project takes this one step further by letting the user say where the text gets "wrapped."

### Usage

To use this program, enter your message and come up with a PIN. The longer it is, the longer you may want your password to be. You can still have a short number, though, because that can loop until it reaches the end of the array.

**You should use another layer of encryption to prevent potential brute force attacks!**
